# Anland — a Wayland host for Android

**English** | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

Anland runs the graphical Linux apps of a container on a **rooted Android** device and shows each of them as a **native Android window** — its own entry in the app switcher, its own Surface, its own soft-keyboard focus. There is no virtual screen and no mirroring: every app gets a real window, and Android's own compositor keeps drawing the screen.

It ships as a SukiSU/KernelSU module (`anland-awl`): a root daemon, a host APK, the session inside the container, and an audio bridge. The companion launcher [anland-shell](https://github.com/SuperTurtleDev/anland-shell) manages the containers and starts the apps.

**Why the rewrite?** 5.x exchanged frames over a private display protocol (the
"Anland Display Protocol"): every compositor — KWin, Weston, … — needed its own
adaptation backend written against that protocol, and each of those had to be
maintained separately. The 6.x refactor makes Wayland itself the frame-exchange
protocol, so stock compositors work unmodified and only the host side needs
maintaining.

## Why it is not a standard compositor

A standard Wayland compositor — Weston, Sway, a desktop session — takes over a machine's display: it owns the whole screen, composites every client into one output, reads input from evdev, and clients reach it through the `wayland-0` socket. On a phone that model degrades into "one fullscreen remote-desktop window". Anland keeps the protocol half of a compositor and replaces the display half with Android itself:

| | Standard compositor | Anland |
|---|---|---|
| Screen | Owns the display, composites everything into one output | Owns no display — Android's SurfaceFlinger keeps compositing |
| Windows | Internal window management inside a single output | Every `xdg_toplevel` becomes one real Android window (its own Activity and Surface) |
| Connection | A `wayland-0` unix socket file | No socket file — connections are fds passed over Android binder |
| Client identity | All clients are the same session user | Every client connects with its own uid; windows are owned per app |
| Input | evdev/libinput from DRM devices | Each window's Android touch/key/IME events, translated to Wayland |
| Lifecycle | A user session process | A root daemon in its own SELinux domain — not an app uid, so OEM "battery optimization" cannot freeze it |

What that design buys you:

- **Linux windows are first-class Android windows.** They appear in the app switcher, split-screen and behave like ordinary app windows — each with its own focus and its own IME state, candidates following the cursor.
- **Hidden windows park their clients.** With no Android surface attached, the daemon stops draining that window's buffers, so a minimized Linux app neither spins nor burns GPU frames.
- **Foreground apps are scheduled like foreground apps.** While a window is attached, its client's whole process tree is moved into Android's top-app cgroups — the Linux app in front of you is scheduled like any foreground Android app, not like a background daemon.
- **Sound included.** A PulseAudio bridge plays the container's audio through Android's own audio stack.
- **X11 apps included.** The in-container session runs a patched rootless Xwayland, so X11 apps show up as windows the same way Wayland apps do.
- **Real-device fixes the stock stack lacks.** A bubblewrap that survives KernelSU+SuSFS fake mount ids, and an Xwayland that does accelerated GL on Adreno GPUs (kgsl/turnip) — see `patches/`.
- **Any Android app can join in.** The `libawl` client library lets a third-party app connect over binder and host its own Wayland windows, scoped to that app's uid.

## How it fits together

    subgraph LC ["Linux container (Droidspaces)"]
        APP ["GUI apps — Wayland & X11"]
        SESS ["anlandx session<br/>Xwayland + session D-Bus"]
    end
    subgraph AND ["Android"]
        D ["waylandbridge root daemon<br/>Wayland protocol + GPU"]
        H ["host APK<br/>one Activity per window"]
        SF ["SurfaceFlinger"]
        P ["PulseAudio bridge"]
    end
    APP --> SESS
    SESS -- "wayland socket" --> D
    D -- "binder: attach / control / input" --> H
    H -- "per-window Surfaces" --> SF
    APP -- "pulse socket" --> P
```

The pieces:

- **`waylandbridge`** — the daemon: a single statically-linked ELF holding both the Wayland protocol side and the GPU renderer. It renders each window's frames directly into the Surface of that window's Android Activity.
- **Host APK (`com.anlandnext`)** — spawns one Activity per window, feeds it input, and provides the window list and settings UI.
- **`libawl`** — the client library (AAR) that third-party apps embed to host their own windows.
- **anlandx** — the session inside the container: links the daemon's socket, runs rootless Xwayland with a small X window manager, and publishes the app environment.
- **pulse** — PulseAudio for Android (OpenSL ES / AAudio sinks) so container apps have sound.
- **module** — the SukiSU/KernelSU packaging: boot service, SELinux domain, contexts generated at flash time from the device's live system files.

## Rendering backends: SC and EGL

The daemon composites each window through one of two backends, selected by
`sc_enabled` in the daemon config (`/data/adb/modules/anland-awl/config.json`,
default `1`; applied when a window attaches):

- **SC (SurfaceControl) — efficient, low overhead, scanout direct.** Every
  wayland layer becomes a SurfaceControl sibling and SurfaceFlinger/HWC does the
  compositing — the daemon composites nothing, and a client's dma-buf can be
  scanned out zero-copy on an HWC plane. The trade-off: surface *movement*
  responds more slowly, since positions land through SF transactions. Best for
  content whose surfaces mostly sit still — games.
- **EGL (GL renderer) — smooth movement, higher GPU usage.** A per-window GPU
  compositor samples every layer into one buffer and presents it through
  eglSwapBuffers. Surface movement is smooth, at the price of a GPU composite
  every frame. Best for scrolling content — web browsing.

## Requirements

- A rooted arm64 device (SukiSU or KernelSU)
- A Droidspaces Linux container
- The host APK installed — windows attach through it, and audio requires it

## Install

1. Get the three artifacts: `build/module/anland-awl.zip`, `build/anland-wayland.apk`, `build/anlandx.tar.gz` — build them (below) or take them from CI.
2. Flash the zip in your root manager and reboot. The daemon starts at boot (log: `/data/local/tmp/awl_daemon.log`).
3. Install `anland-wayland.apk`.
4. Inside the container, set up the session:

   ```sh
   tar xzf anlandx.tar.gz && bash anlandx/setupanlandx.sh
   ```

5. Manage containers and launch apps with [anland-shell](https://github.com/SuperTurtleDev/anland-shell).

## Build

Linux host with JDK 17, an Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` set; missing pieces are auto-installed), plus meson/ninja/patch for the audio part.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
make        # waylandbridge + host APK + module zip + anlandx tarball
```

CI builds every push/PR and uploads the artifacts.
